## Introduction

**Protocol Name:** SingularityNET

**Category:** AI

**Smart Contract:** AGIToken

## Function Analysis

**Function Name:** `approveAndCall`

**Block Explorer Link:** [Etherscan - SingularityNET AGIToken](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5B7533812759B45C2B44C19e320ba2cD2681b542#code)

**Function Code:**
```solidity
function approveAndCall(address spender, uint tokens, bytes data) public returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][spender] = tokens;
    Approval(msg.sender, spender, tokens);
    require(spender.call(data)); // high-level call
    return true;
}
```
Explanation

Purpose:

This method is used in conjunction with the approveAndCall function of the AGIToken contract, enabling a spender to spend an indicated amount of tokens and then call a function provided in the spender's contract. It allows token contracts to make a request of other contracts in one function call to make sure complex operations are performed in one transaction.

 Detailed Use:
 
Sets the amount of tokens allowed for the spender in the caller's account.
It emits an Approval event to log the approval operation.
It proceeds from here to use call to implement one of the functions on the spender contact, passing the data parameter, which consists of the encoded function invocation and its arguments.

Impact:

The approveAndCall function optimizes the interaction of the AGIToken contract with other contracts, by wrapping the approval and function call in one transaction.
The use of call allows the function to be flexible, being able to interact with numerous different spender contracts, so that use can be applied to a multiplicity of different operations, such as paying for AI services on the SingularityNET platform.
This way, the protocol will be more efficient by reducing the effort to make quite a few transactions whenever called, therefore saving gas fees and subsequently improving the user experience.
The approveAndCall in the AGIToken contract gives a good example of how, when combined, AI and blockchain technologies by SingularityNET provide a seamless way to interact with AI services using cryptocurrency.
